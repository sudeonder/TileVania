Welcome to our 2D side-scrolling platformer game project! In this game, you'll control a character who navigates through various levels, jumping over obstacles and reaching the end goal.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create an engaging platformer game using Unity's tile map system. Here's a brief overview of what we'll be working on:

- **Character Movement:** Implementing player controls for running, jumping, and interacting with the environment.
- **Level Design:** Designing visually appealing levels using Unity's tile map system, including obstacles, platforms, and background elements.
- **Level Loading System:** Creating a seamless transition between levels, allowing players to progress from one level to the next upon completion.
- **Game Mechanics:** Introducing game mechanics such as collectibles, enemies and checkpoints to add depth and challenge to the gameplay.
